# IPL-team-winning--predictor-Project
it is a Machine learning project that predict the winning percentage of team on the basis of match Venue,target score,fall of wicket,and current score.
First i download the data set from Kaggle,you can download the dataset from below link.

Dtaset Link-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020

I have made this project in my beginner phase.i did some EDA process like  univariate analysis ,multivariate analysis , null value handling ,Handling categorical columns
and also use matplotlib ,seaborn library to visualize the data.
also applied column transformer ,and make ML Pipelines after all i applied Logistic regression Algorithm and achieve 81% accuracy. 

Here is theory about the Logistic Regression algorithm.

# Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm which is mostly used for binary classification problems. Although “regression” contradicts with “classification”, the focus here is on the word “logistic” referring to logistic function which does the classification task in this algorithm. Logistic regression is a simple yet very effective classification algorithm so it is commonly used for many binary classification tasks. Customer churn, spam email, website or ad click predictions are some examples of the areas where logistic regression offers a powerful solution.

The basis of logistic regression is the logistic function, also called the sigmoid function, which takes in any real valued number and maps it to a value between 0 and 1.

Logistic regression model takes a linear equation as input and use logistic function and log odds to perform a binary classification task. Before going in detail on logistic regression, it is better to review some concepts in the scope probability.
